# SYSTEMTRON INTERN TASKS ON AI/ML

This repository contains the four projects that I worked on during my internship at SystemTron. Each project is designed to showcase my skills in datascience and Machine learning. Here's a brief overview of each project:

1. **Diabetes Prediction**: A machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on certain features such as age, BMI, and blood pressure. The model is built using [Random forest]. Contributions are welcome!

2. **Car Prediction**: A machine learning model that predicts the price of a car based on certain features such as mileage, horsepower, and number of cylinders. The model is built using [Linear Regression]. Contributions are welcome!

3. **IPL Match Prediction**: A machine learning model that predicts the winner of an IPL match based on the team's past performance and other factors. The model is built using [Random Forest Regression]. Contributions are welcome!

4. **Breast Cancer Prediction**: A machine learning model that predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on certain features such as radius, texture, and perimeter. The model is built using [Logistic Regression]. Contributions are welcome!

Please feel free to explore each project and provide feedback. Thank you for visiting!
